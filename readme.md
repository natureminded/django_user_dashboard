# Remaining:
+ Deploy

+ Have the first user be an admin
    + Give a message

# Later:
+ clean up error tags -- simple nomenclature, ie: "profile_errors" would become "errors", and thus referenced in the template as `message_tags="profile error"` instead of `message_tags="profile_errors error"`
+ modularize models.py
+ Style, clean up, refactor.
+ Setup lots of exceptions (for back button submission on forms -- delete , etc, etc.)

# Beautify:
+ Add bootstrap:
    - Show User Page
    - Add New User Page
    - Admin Update User Page
