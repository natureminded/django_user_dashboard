# Remaining:
+ Admin Edit User / Edit password
+ Normal Edit User / Edit Password
+ Confirm Delete
+ Comment errors appear in wrong section (they appear by the message field)
+ Deploy


# Later:
+ clean up error tags -- simple nomenclature, ie: "profile_errors" would become "errors", and thus referenced in the template as `message_tags="profile error"` instead of `message_tags="profile_errors error"`
+ modularize models.py
+ Style, clean up, refactor.
+ Setup lots of exceptions (for back button submission on forms -- delete , etc, etc.)

# Beautify:
+ Add bootstrap
+ Add jquery fade outs on errors or at least info messages
